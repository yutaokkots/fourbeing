# Description

</div>

The name, 'fourbeing' was inspired by the following: (1) The brahmavihārā (four immeasurables), (2) Ikigai (reason for being), and (3) The Four Reminders / Preliminaries. Each of these concepts suggest following their four tenets to live fulfillingly. 

To that end, fourbeing was created with simplicity in mind, and ease of access for conversation and community. 

The app features openAI's GPT-3 Text-davinci-003 model as a collapsable React component to allow users to translate written text accurately between 15 languages. 

The App was built with a Django back-end supported by django-rest-framework to allow for RESTful communication from incoming requests. The models are PostgreSQL. 

The frontend app was built with React and the react-router-dom library. UI elements were inspired by Reddit (hence 'a reddit clone').


This ver 1.0 of fourbeing was tailored for both mobile and desktop use.
